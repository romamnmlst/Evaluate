Evaluate
========

A program that analyzes plain text file(s). It displays the number of 
characters in the file, the number of unique characters, the number of 
lines, and the number of words (any string of characters separated by 
white space). Finally, it displays every character used, with the 
number of times each character is used, in ascending order. If a file
cannot be found, the user is alerted, and the program moves to the 
next file to evaluate.
